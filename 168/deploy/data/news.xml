	<title>Westboro Baptist Hates Radiohead</title>
	<date>04/11/2012</date>
	<description>I have the great dishonor of saying that my experience with Topeka’s Westboro Baptist Church goes way back — Topeka is about 20 minutes away from where I went to school and about 30 minutes away from where I grew up — so it’s no surprise to me that the hate group was out trolling last night’s Radiohead show in Kansas City, reprising their familiar role (I think those are even the same signs!). According to At Ease Web, the ever-disgusting presence issued a mandate on their website justifying the protest, a screed that read:

You have stolen the Word of God from your people and children, and as a sorry substitute, you prop up lightness and lies. You try to get the people to look at the nonsense and not at the wrath of God that abides upon them. “Look at the circus monkey over there and the fluffy setting, blah, blah…” Meanwhile, God is undoing this nation and effecting all of your lives, with the moth that quietly eats the very fabric of your national garment. Radiohead is just such an event. Freak monkey’s with mediocre tunes keeps you busy and focused by lightness. It changes nothing, God is undoing and digging up and throwing down this nation.</description>
